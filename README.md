##  Local Question Structure

Local questions are stored in a Python dictionary within the file:

```
LOCAL_QUESTIONS = {
"tech": [
{"question": "What does CPU stand for?", "answer": "central processing unit"},
{"question": "What is FIFO in data structures?", "answer": "queue"},
# ...
],
"science": [
{"question": "What gas do plants absorb?", "answer": "carbon dioxide"},
# ...
],
# ...
}
```


 You can add new categories or questions directly to this dictionary!

---

##  Online Mode

The game fetches live trivia questions using the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/).

Example API call:

```bash
https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=5&type=multiple&category=18&difficulty=medium
```


The category IDs are automatically mapped:

| Category              | API ID |
|-----------------------|--------|
| General Knowledge     | 9      |
| Science               | 17     |
| Geography             | 22     |
| Tech (Computers)      | 18     |
| Health                | 27     |
